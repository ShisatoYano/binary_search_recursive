# binary_search_recursive

* Sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval half.  
* If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half.  
* Otherwise narrow it to the upper half.  
* Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.  
* Time complexity to O(Log n).
